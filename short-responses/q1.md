# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

Any bad actor can read the key from their client and use it to do whatever they want, like run up your api bill. Making the request from the server ensures the key is never exposed to the client.
